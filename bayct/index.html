   WELCOME TO THE" 
 <BR>
 BORED APE YACTH CLUB"
 <br>      
</P>
<p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>

    There are no bonding curves here. Buying a Bored Ape costs 0.08 ETH. There

    are no price tiers; BAYC membership costs the same for everyone.

<P>
    Note: Thirty apes are being withheld from the sale. <br>
    These will be used for giveaways, puzzle rewards—and <br>
    for the creators' BAYC memberships

<P>When you buy a Bored Ape, you're not simply buying an avatar or a provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining membership access to a club whose benefits and offerings will increase over time.
     Your Bored Ape can serve as your digital identity, and open digital doors for you.</P>

    <h1><B>THE BATHROOM</B></h1>
 <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write expletives.</p>

    <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.</p>
    
   <p> We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.</p>
